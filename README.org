An unofficial Emacs client for Amp's IDE mode. Because who needs JetBrains
when you have the one true editor?

Heavily inspired by [[https://github.com/manzaltu/claude-code-ide.el][claude-code-ide.el]]

* Status

This is very much a work in progress. The basic plumbing works, but expect
rough edges. Currently implements the core WebSocket protocol that Amp's
=--jetbrains= flag expects.

* Usage

1. Load the package:
#+begin_src elisp
(load-file "amp.el")
#+end_src

2. Start the IDE server for your current project:
#+begin_src
M-x amp-start-ide-server
#+end_src

3. Launch Amp in another terminal:
#+begin_src shell
amp --jetbrains
#+end_src

4. Watch the magic happen. Or debug with =M-x amp-debug-buffer= when it doesn't.

* What Works

- Project-aware WebSocket servers
- File and selection tracking
- Basic authentication with Amp CLI
- Automatic cleanup (mostly)

* What Doesn't

- Probably a lot.

* Requirements

- Emacs 28.1+
- =websocket= package
- =project= package (built-in)
- Amp CLI that supports =--jetbrains= flag

* Commands

| Command                | Purpose                          |
|------------------------+----------------------------------|
| =amp-start-ide-server= | Start server for current project |
| =amp-stop-ide-server=  | Stop server for current project  |
| =amp-ide-status=       | Show connection status           |
| =amp-debug-buffer=     | View WebSocket debug logs        |
